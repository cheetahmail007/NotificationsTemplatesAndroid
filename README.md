## Why Notification Channel?
Channels were introduced in Oreo, and allow users to select which notifications their applications can show them. As application developers 
we should our notifications based on their topic. If an application uses only one channel for all of its notifications, the user would not be 
able to select which notifications they want to see and if they blocked one channel, they would no longer get notifications from the application.
